		<h1>Reviews Classifications</h1>

  <div class="project-description">
    This repository holds the code and other files used to predict whether a review is positive or negative. In it, we scrap the data from the web about the reviews made about WorldRemit and classify reviews using different classifiers in Sklearn library of Python. At the moment of making this post, there are 36456 reviews on the site.

    The data available is highly imbalanced: there are so many positive reviews (94% of the training set) than negative(4%) or neutral(2%). So, in this project we fitted the model on the the imbalanced data and also on balanced data (dropped positive excesses so that we have same number of positive and negative reviews.). The full description is available <a href="https://github.com/kipronokoech/Reviews-Classification/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">here.</a>
