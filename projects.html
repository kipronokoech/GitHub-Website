    This repository holds the code and other files used to predict whether a review is positive or negative. In it, we scrap the data from the web about the reviews made about WorldRemit and classify reviews using different classifiers in Sklearn library of Python. At the moment of making this post, there are 36456 reviews on the site.

    The data available is highly imbalanced: there are so many positive reviews (94% of the training set) than negative(4%) or neutral(2%). So, in this project we fitted the model on the the imbalanced data and also on balanced data (dropped positive excesses so that we have same number of positive and negative reviews.). The full description is available <a href="https://github.com/kipronokoech/Reviews-Classification/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">here.</a>

    This is a classification problem applied to Agriculture. This project was presented as a solution to a <a href="https://zindi.africa/" target="_blank">Zindi Competition</a> and ranked as top 15% solution.
    <p>
      The objective of this project is to build a machine learning algorithm to correctly classify if a plant (wheat) is healthy, has stem rust, or has leaf rust.
      876 images were used to train the model and 610 images used for testing. Some images may contain both stem and leaf rust, but there is always one type of rust that is more dominant than the other, i.e. you will not find images where both appear equally. The goal is to classify the image according to the type of wheat rust that it has.

      Unfortunately, Zindi reserves the ownership of the data and as such the data may not be published here. A work around, however, is to get the data from the challenge page <a href="https://zindi.africa/competitions/iclr-workshop-challenge-1-cgiar-computer-vision-for-crop-disease/data" target="_blank">[link]</a> . More information are on the <a href="https://github.com/kipronokoech/Crop-Disease-Classfiication/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README</a> and the code is on the link below.

      The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

      On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

      While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. This implies that predictive modelling can be done to determine chances of survival and what factors affected the chances of survival.

      This project entails predicting whether a given passenger survived or succumbed. The model is purely build on Tensorflow.

      Results: After training, the linear classifier achieved 82% accuracy on training data and 78% for test set.
